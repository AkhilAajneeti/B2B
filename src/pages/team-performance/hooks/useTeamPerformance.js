/**
 * Team Performance aggregation.
 *
 * Reuses the Reports dataset service rather than adding a second full-table
 * fetch: that service already pages the year's leads concurrently, dedupes
 * in-flight requests and persists to localStorage, so this report shares a
 * network round trip with the Win Rate and Funnel charts instead of doubling
 * the load on the gateway.
 *
 * All aggregation is a single pass over the records. The dataset can run to
 * thousands of leads, and the per-project index below needs the same pass, so
 * building both in one loop keeps this O(n) rather than O(n x projects).
 *
 * WHY THE FETCH IS NOT PAGED, even though the table is.
 *
 * Every number here is an aggregate over the whole period. Net Q% is a rep's
 * qualified leads over their connected leads; the qualification index is that
 * rate measured against the TEAM's rate on the same projects. Both need every
 * lead in the window counted before either can be stated.
 *
 * Fetch 20 leads at a time and the arithmetic quietly changes meaning: a rep
 * would be ranked on whichever slice happened to load, the team baseline would
 * shift with every page, and the ranking would reorder as you clicked. It would
 * render fine and be wrong — the worst failure mode in a report people make
 * staffing decisions from.
 *
 * So the load is reduced where it can be reduced honestly:
 *   - the period defaults to one MONTH, not a year (~12x fewer rows);
 *   - the select carries seven fields, not the full lead record;
 *   - pages after the first are fetched concurrently, capped at MAX_LEADS;
 *   - the result is cached in localStorage and shared with the Reports charts
 *     under the same query key, so a second view costs nothing.
 *
 * The table itself paginates at 20 rows, which is what pagination can safely
 * do here: it limits what is RENDERED, not what is counted.
 *
 * Paging the fetch becomes correct only when the backend can aggregate — the
 * spec's daily summary table (date, project, source, rep). Then this page asks
 * for a handful of pre-computed rows instead of every lead.
