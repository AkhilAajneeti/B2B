/**
 * Qualification rules for the Team Performance report.
 *
 * THE CORE RULE (from the Reports Module spec): a lead counts as qualified if
 * it EVER held a qualifying status, even if its status today is Not Interested.
 * Counting only today's status punishes both the lead source and the rep who
 * did the qualifying — a buyer who asked for a brochure was a genuine prospect,
 * and going cold afterwards is a sales outcome, not a bad lead.
 *
 * WHERE THE HISTORY COMES FROM. The spec assumes none of this works without a
 * new status-change log. That is only half true here: EspoCRM already keeps
 * `cStatusObj` on every Lead — the list of statuses the lead has passed
 * through. It is what the "Previously in status" filter reads (see the
 * arrayAnyOf clause in services/leads.service.js). So Ever-Qualified is
 * computable from data we already have.
 *
 * What `cStatusObj` does NOT carry is timestamps or attribution: when each
 * change happened and who made it. That gap is exactly why this report ships
 * without the speed columns (median first response, reached-within-5-min,
 * overdue follow-ups) — those need a real status-change log on the backend.
