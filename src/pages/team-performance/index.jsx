 * Team Performance — Report 2 of the CRM Reports Module spec.
 *
 * Ranks reps on how many of their CONNECTED leads they qualify, counting every
 * lead that was ever qualified rather than only those sitting in a qualifying
 * status today. See utils/qualification.js for the rule and where the history
 * comes from.
 *
 * Visible to the Owner role and to admins by type — see canSeeTeamPerformance
 * in utils/permission. Managers are excluded on purpose: this is a review of
 * how leads were worked, not rep tooling.
 *
 * Gated in two places, because either one alone is not a gate:
 *   - the sidebar entry (presentation), and
 *   - the route itself, via ProtectedRoute's `allow` — without it the page is
 *     one typed URL away for anybody.
 *
 * Both read the SAME predicate, so the button and the URL cannot disagree.

 * default meant ~12x the rows for a report most people read month to month.
 *
 * Why the window and not a paged fetch: see the note on the fetch in
 * hooks/useTeamPerformance.js. Narrowing the window is the only way to load
 * less without making the numbers wrong.

            Median first response, reached-within-5-minutes and overdue
            follow-ups are not shown. The CRM records which statuses a lead has
            passed through, but not when each change happened, so there is no
            honest way to measure response time yet — that needs a status-change
            log on the backend. Contact&nbsp;% is derived from statuses alone and
            so is a floor: a rep who spoke to a buyer without moving the status
            reads as not connected.
